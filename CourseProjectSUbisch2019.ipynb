    "The purpose of this project is to investigate whether text-based indicators of product similarity can help explain product performance. This is an active research area in Strategic Management and related disciplines. Text-based measures have gradually started to supplement or replace traditional, static industry classifications in research and typically outperform the latter in terms of explanatory power (see Hoberg & Phillips, 2010; 2016). Similar indicators are now seeing use in the categories or strategic categorization literature (see Zuckerman, 1999 and Hsu, 2006, for early, influential accounts). A recent paper in this field using text analysis is Barlow, Veerhal, and Angus, 2019: \"Optimal distinctiveness, strategic categorization, and product market entry on the Google Play app platform\" (henceforth BVA). To summarize, this paper shows that, in order to get a large number of downloads, new apps on Google Play must be different from the \"average\" app while at the same time be similar to high-performing apps. For the purpose of this course paper, I will replicate (with some caveats due to data limitations) and elaborate on the analysis in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original goal of the project was to hand collect data from company bios in press releases from the Factiva database. However, it appeared that my school's subscription did not include access to this functionality (the conventional user interface only allows for a small number of downloads at a time). Contacting PR Newswire directly proved equally fruitless, as they would not grant access to their API for research purposes (they were not interested in letting me download historical, and thus largely worthless, press releases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given time constraints, collecting my own data for this project unfortunately proved too complicated. I will therefore skip the data collection part and focus more on pandas programming (I was completely new to Python before this course) and analysis. Instead of collecting my own data, I will borrow a dataset from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games, containing information about App Store Strategy Games. In terms of useful content, this dataset is among the most comprehensive I could find within reasonable time. It contains data on a fair number of products (N is about 7k after all cleaning and subsetting steps) across features such as textual product descriptions, release date, ratings, and number of user ratings etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset shares many features with the data in BVA. One important difference is that while their data covers the time period from early 2015 to mid 2016, my data spans over several years from 2009 to 2019, allowing me to go further in exploring the time dimension. However, they have a much larger sample than I, covering all sorts of categories, while I focus on a particular category of games. Importantly, BVA collected their data dynamically. Thus, they have performance data broken down by month, whereas my corresponding data is an accumulated snapshot from the point in time the data was collected (August 2019). However, this may not be as big a problem as it normally would since the main independent variables are based on app text descriptions that generally do not vary over time, precluding conventional panel analysis regardless. I further attempt to mitigate issues stemming from my data structure and limitations in a number of ways that I will detail as I go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I consider it unlikely that I will attempt to write an academic paper based on the analysis of this particular dataset, I take this as an opportunity to familiarize myself with Python programming and text analysis in particularly. My goal is apply what I develop and learn here on a more interesting and comprehensive dataset in the future."

    "Here, I will briefly explain the main theoretical concepts as well as the broad research goal of this paper. This is not by any stretch intended to be an inclusive review of the relevant literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Optimal distinctiveness originated in social psychology in relation to how individuals develop a unique identity while facing considerable pressures of conformity (Brewer, 1991). Similar to individuals, we can also imagine firms having identities and struggling to find the appropriate balance between novelty and legitimacy (Deephouse, 1999). In this literature, it is well documented that a firm's identity, as it is perceived by relevant audiences, will affect performance outcomes, where ambiguous identities typically lead to ignorance or penalty in the marketplace. Thus, to some extent, organizations need to conform to established norms and boundaries associated with their category. At the same time, too high a degree of conformity pose the risk of making the organization, and its offerings, appear less distinct and for practical purposes disappear in the crowded marketplace. Somewhat peculiarly, in this stream of literature, it is quite common that the empirical analysis actually deals with product offerings, presumably treating these more or less as representations of the organizations in question, while the theoretical side is more focused on the organizational level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal distinctiveness can be conceptualized across many dimensions. In BVA, they focus on two: Prototype and exemplar similarity. Prototype similarity builds on earlier work in cognitive psychology (Rorsch & Lloyd, 1978) and refers to the extent that an entity shares features with a typical representative of a certain group or category. Exemplars, on the other hand, would be entities that, while conforming to a given category, clearly stand out in terms of performance or renown.\n",
    "\n",
    "BVA hypothesize that offerings with higher levels of prototype similarity basically will be \"lost in the crowd\", while higher levels of exemplar similarity will result in favorable attention from consumers. Moreover they expect a negative interaction between the two, so that higher levels of prototype similarity will diminish the positive effect of exemplar similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of BVA however, is the relatively short timespan of observation. Currently in this stream of research, there is little consideration of the temporal dimension (Zhao, Fisher, Lounsbury, & Miller, 2017), which is what I therefore intend to explore. BVA also focus on the number of downloads (proxied by the number of user ratings) as their outcome variable, while other performance measures might be considered. The saliency of prototype and exemplar similarity may vary over time depending on the degree of crowding in the marketplace. In less crowded markets, for instance, the penalty associated with prototype similarty may be less severe. Second, the number of users is but dimension of performance. While a large number of downloads may be regarded as beneficial by most producers, it is unlikely to be the ultimate goal for all. Some product are likely to be intended for more niche audiences rather than maximizing units sold in to the mainstream audience. Therefore, the total number of downloads may matter less relative to having an active user base for a longer period of time. Indeed, several streams of research in strategy and organizational studies suggest a tradeoff between short term profits and long term survival (see Cattani, Porac, & Thomas, 2017, for a review). Thus, in addition to replicating the analysis in BVA, I will also replace the outcome variable with an alternative performance indicator of survival, and investigate whether prototype and exemplar similarity also may predict performance along this dimension."

The number of days between the original and current version may indicate to what extent the app is \"alive\". There is probably very little, if any cost associated with letting a more or less defunct app remain on the platform, while apps with an active customer base are likely to get updates. Of course, it is possible that an app may be in use, and get more downloads, even if it it was not updated recently. I assume that is generally less likely."

    "We move on to compute exemplar similarity. In BVA, the exemplar similarity is computed as the maximum cosine similarity between the focal app and the 100 most downloaded apps released in the previous month. While BVA have millions of app-month observations, my data is much more limited. Therefore, I make some adjustments. First, I use the top 5 apps in terms of the number of user ratings they receive. Second, since I do not have dynamic, i.e. by month, data for number of reviews, I rank within the previous year. Given the theoretical exposition on exemplars, I would argue that it would take some time for the market to determine who are these exemplars. Probably more than one month in most cases. Given both data limitations and theoretical considerations, I use the previous year as the time window rather than the previous month."

    "For prototype similarity, the effect is generally negative in subsequent years relative to 2009, although the difference is not significant. However, it appears that the negative effect is diminishing in more recent years. This may suggest that prototype conformity is not penalized by the market as much as it used to. The market is becoming more \"mainstream\" and consumers may be okay with products being less novel or distinct. It may also be the case that prototype similarity is losing leverage in more crowded markets. As markets become more crowded and multifaceted, it becomes harded for consumers to determine typicality.\n",

    "Results of regressions on the log of the number of days are largely similar to regressions on the log of the number of user ratings. This also reflects the high correlation between the two variables, which remains a limitation in our analysis. However, regarding app survival, results indicate that prototype similarity is particularly detrimental as the market is crowding. The effect of exemplar similarity does not change much over time. It remains important regardless of the level of market crowding. This suggests that optimal strategies for apps may be slightly different depending on whether the goal is to maximize downloads or long term service, when facing markets with different levels of density.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of model fit, as indicated by R-squared, is also evidently harder to account for the variation in the number of days relative to the number of user ratings, with scores around 0.25 in the former case and 0.7 in the latter. One reason is that the number of days between original and current version release remains a somewhat ambiguous indicator of performance. Not all apps may require the same amount of maintenance over time, and games of course vary in complexity."

    "In this paper, I replicate and elaborate on the analysis in BVA. My results are generally consistent with BVA. In addition to replicating the analysis with regard to the number of user ratings, I go further to assess the potential significance of prototype and exemplar similarity over time as the the app market is becoming increasingly crowded. Generally, I find little difference accross time with regard to prototype similarity, while exemplar similarity appears to become increasingly salient as the market is becoming more dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also enquire into another dimension of organizational performance, namely survival. Interestingly, I find that prototype and exemplar similarity have qualitatively similar effects on survival as on the number of user ratings. Results suggest that higher levels of prototype similarity may be particularly detrimental for app producers entertaining a more long term strategy. This is consistent with conventional intuition that run-of-the-mill products generally will not survive for very long. However, regardless of quality, it is possible for producers to boost performance by mimicing other select high performers in the marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are opportunities for further work in this area. Although reviewers evidently have found it acceptable, I am not sure how well prototype similarity actually measures the \"average\" product. Exemplar similarity, on the other hand, is based on cosine similarity which seems to be considered a relatively uninformative indicator in the data science community (https://medium.com/@adriensieg/text-similarities-da019229c894). Further work could attempt to validate or refine these indicators or apply more sophisticated ones in the context of stratey research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I have learned a lot from this exercise. Not only has this been a first foray into the world of python programming, I am now familiar with text based analysis, including cleaning and preparing text for further analysis, and computing albeit basic similarity indicators. I believe there will be many opportunities to apply and expand these skills in the years to come."
